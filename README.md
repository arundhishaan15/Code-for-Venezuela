# Code-for-Venezuela
General Public Health Services for Venezuelan Hospitals

In this project we focused on the Power and Water shortage problems in Venezuelan Hospitals. The data is collected through a survey by Doctors for Health, Venezuelan organization from Doctors and health professionals in Venezuela. The data cleaning process involves removing duplicates, matching primary keys between datasets, spanish to english translations, and transforming categorical values into numerical forms of data to get new metrics. 

We have designed dashboards in Tableau that gives information about average power outage per day and water shortage of hospitals in different states and specific time period. This would help patients download information periodically and create awarenesss about hospitals. Further, we also focused on Mortality due to Power outage. This data could help us provide the necessary support to hospitals ahead of time.
